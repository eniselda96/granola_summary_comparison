      transcript: `Me: Hello?  Them: Hello?  Me: I did. Get get.  Them: I'm good. Thanks. How are you?  Me: Yeah. Thanks for, thanks for coming on and for chatting with me.  Them: Ah, no worries. I actually managed to, get, my colleagues to start using Granola. So and doing some evangelism.  Me: I love it. I love it. I thought I'd seen a few from, yes. Come on. So 7 sign on. Right?  Them: Yeah. Yeah.  Me: Yeah.  Them: Well, I mean, I actually had some some days off.  Me: Nice. Nice. How's, how have you been funding it? It sounds like, it looks like you haven't you haven't been able to use it in a while. So I'm curious to understand if that's the case and why and and and stuff like that. But yeah. Nice.  Them: I was traveling. So  Me: That's loud.  Them: that that was the main reason, why I didn't use it. But, but in general, like like, I mean, I I find it really useful. So I mean, it's definitely been helping. I mean, I don't have a great memory, so it's  Me: Mhmm.  Them: it's it's it's good to be able to go and, like, refer, back to these notes that I would be this state. So like this kind of core thing thing is amazing. I mean, I have a kind of few smaller  Me: Mhmm.  Them: specific feedback, like more around like, the  Me: Mhmm.  Them: or the the the this kind of enhanced notes So, like, one thing that I was missing is, being able to expand on some of the sections that were, like, the most important parts of the chat. Where, like, I don't know, like, there's a new piece of that they're, like, more Demmel would be, like, super useful. So say, for example, it's like a workshop, and then there there's kind of more general brainstorming and stuff, but they're like, I don't know, towards the end.  Me: Mhmm.  Them: Kind of really can get into looking down some sort of, like, next steps and, like, things we want to do on the product, for example. And then there, it would be amazing if, like, in that particular section, there would be a way to, like, expand those notes out which then can become like more like a like a start for a document to write up. And then I actually adjust this because I I was like Preparing like, 10 minutes to this for this conversation, I noticed those little, like, zoom in icons on hover. Which is which is great to, like, be able to, you know, peak into more context. So I was I was wondering that maybe, like, that could be the way to Like,  Me: Yeah. Yes.  Them: to to I mean, I didn't not see something else. So maybe it's a bit hidden, but to be able to some details from from from those conversations, like, back into the notes.  Me: Yeah. That makes a lot of sense. That makes a lot of sense. Yeah. Can imagine if you were doing, like, a long brainstorm especially, Yeah. The the notes would just be way too high level and not detailed enough on certain parts that you that you cared about. Yeah. Yeah.  Them: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I mean, I think those high level notes are great. So so I mean, I really like that this sort of like the default level of detail. So it doesn't kind of turn into, like, well, take too long too long for everyone to read. So I think I think that that's great. It's it's I mean, and then sometimes I manually did it like bistat were like people were just kind of chatting and it's not really that important to all. Like, and if these days stand up, sort of, like, conversations. But yeah.  Me: That makes sense. That makes sense.  Them: But then yeah. Then bringing bringing more detail on, like, the real kind of meat subjects. Okay.  Me: Can you think back to a To the example sounds like you have an example in mind, like a particular meeting where this where you where you felt this. I'm curious, like, There are different things, I guess, that I that come to mind for me. 1 is, like, we could, we for each bullet point, like, you could, like, expand the bullet point into several bullet points or something. Like, you know, like a like, make it longer. Or we could, like, make a section more detailed, I guess. Like, the whole like, the next step section, for example. I'm curious if if if, like, I don't know. Just a just a way to be able to just, like, say, put more detail here feels like useful or whether you feel like you might need more control than that, you know, like like, more specificity over what you want there what you wanna do, how you wanna change the text.  Them: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So that that's that's fine. I thought that, like, as a workflow, like, using this kind of zoom in sort of, like, button and then then more details pop up. And then in there, somehow, I don't know, like, highlight passages or be able to pick there. Like, oh, yeah. Yeah. That was that was like the really kind of important bit. Because otherwise, yeah, I mean, I guess it would might be tricky for for the model to to know like, okay. Well, that's that's the bit that we really wanted to know. But I mean, in in terms of, like, specific examples, like, actually, this Tuesday, we we mostly work remotely, and then we came together for, like, a a workshop session and we were talking about, like, tech road map.  Me: Mhmm.  Them: And then we're looking through, and then so the first half of the conversation was, like, looking through the pitch deck and, and then thinking, okay. What what have you actually promised? But I'm actually promising what to do. We need to quickly build. And then it's like,  Me: Yeah. Yeah.  Them: oh, well, yeah. Yeah. That's like really important. Yeah. Maybe let's let's not put push that. So there was that that bit where like, it was more kind of figuring out where the high level stuff is good. But then towards the end, it was like, okay, so we now identify these kind of free things that we really want to build and then went into detail with those. And then being able to then lift that without because then is basically becoming the input for for, like, like, this stuff, like, Well, like, then if, like, this product, sort of, like, description or whatever. Anyway, so basically, like, this kind of high level features where which we need to then, like, develop a little bit and make into the into a document for for, like, the entire team to to work off. So  Me: Mhmm.  Them: yes, I think especially for, like, if it's not like a catch up kind of thing, but more like a workshop where there's there's an outcome, which is like more sort of like documents or  Me: That makes a lot of sense.  Them: or or something that someone then needs to expand into into, like, a piece of documentation of her. I think that that's workflow, like, it would be amazing.  Me: Yeah. Okay. I've tried to do the same thing in Granola. I thought it was frustrating, actually. Now now you mentioned it like a. Like, I suppose to in that in this circumstance, like, you were kinda up for taking your time over this. Right? Like, like, you do the meeting and then then you're gonna spend a bunch of time turning the meeting into into, like, a spec for for something someone to work on. Sorry. Yeah. Being able to have more fine Granola control over, like, What details Do you pull out in the notes and and  Them: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So I mean, I I think this is, like, super valuable because  Me: much do you write there? And stuff like that sounds really useful.  Them: like like like in in these kind of meetings where you have you have some follow-up work where you need to use whatever was discussed in the chat as input, then Like, that is it's really amazing that, like, there is all this context  Me: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  Them: in in granular that you can use. And all the and also possibly the kind of the decisions that people made in that meeting and not forgetting that, oh, we actually agreed on that kind of thing or we discussed the detail that kind of forget forget. And, like, being able to tell you that sort of like the building blocks for for, like, whoever is then taking up this this this follow-up work to make it into, like, a spec or a more detailed document. Mean, huge time saver.  Me: Yeah. Interesting. Interesting. Words Has it always been you Like, you've done the meeting in Granola. You've got the notes in Granola. And then is it your job to write the spec, or would would other do you expect other people sometimes yeah, be doing that too. Like, I'm curious if they would need access and be able to do this kind of stuff as well.  Them: I mean, in in this particular case, it was actually SEB. Who, who is taking that up because he's he's the the product person. But, I mean, I I also had, like, this this sort of stuff where it was more so so but basically, Sinon is also developer, but then like, what I would personally do is that if we have a conversation with Sinan about, like, okay. So now we have and then that would basically be like downstream from from what Sam us. So set would do like the the product kind of spec sort of thing, which is not making tactical decisions, but  Me: Thank  Them: product decisions. And then we will take it with Cinan and talk it through it. Okay. So how do we actually implement it? And then go through a few alternatives and that sort of stuff.  Me: Mhmm.  Them: And then a really useful document there is this ADRs, which is architectural decision records. Which is basically as at the documentation there, which captures the different alternatives that we considered. And then like, some of the some of the stuff would then be rejected as, like, maybe not ideal. But having that record  Me: Mhmm.  Them: for people to see later or even for ourselves to go back to, okay. Why did we decide not to do that thing? And then we might not remember, but maybe there was a very good reason. And then having having that and being able to then extract from that conversation This this sort of document is, like, super valuable because, like, especially like, if people, like, leave the company and that sort of stuff, then then they take some of this sort of, like, knowledge or maybe just kind of simply fate over the time. Just like people fall things, but being able to pull this out and and, like, be able to refer back to to it later is is amazing. And actually, just again, like, as I was preparing to have a chat, I found these templates.  Me: They are very hidden under you. Yeah.  Them: Because I kind of send you But then but then that I I just just as was saying out. So so then I to fit the conversation into that particular template. So I will actually, like, explore that a bit more like, how could I so but yeah. So so, like, having this even, like, this thing that the outcome I want is, like, Sam, like, is like a product one pager or this ADR or something like that, and then being able to fit the conversation  Me: Mhmm.  Them: into that template. I think that is also like a really amazing thing.  Me: That's fascinating. That makes a lot of sense. I yeah. I I wanna speak way, way better than that. Nice. Could you could you excuse me for 30 seconds? I was gonna go grab a power cable. Laptop's about to die. Cheers. Alright. I'm back. Thanks, William.  Them: No worries.  Me: Anything else on your mind from  Them: There was one thing I wanted to mention, which is like a small  Me: Yeah.  Them: UI. Issue is that if you press this, like, zoom in button, on, like, one of the points.  Me: Uh-huh.  Them: Towards the bottom, then, I mean, it always goes down. And then if it's the way down, like, some of the bits might be cut off from the bottom that you can't go through. I mean, this is just like a small thing, but  Me: Yeah. Okay. Okay. Nice.  Them: And I think  Me: That's good. I I I thought we fixed that at some point, but it sounds like it's broken again. So I'll look I'll look into that. Great. Wanted to ask about, I How you got 7 Stephenson in in Angronet 2 or, like, what that looked like in your company. Like, you started using it. And then I guess, what was the moment when you, you know, mentioned that it was just Tasab and Tasina, and and what about it? Like,  Them: I might have shared some notes of some chat we all participated in. And I mean, I think people always appreciate the the notetaker because it's not something that anyone particularly  Me: Yeah.  Them: like, wants to do, but it's but it's, like, very important. Like, again, especially if there are decisions made And that meeting. And then I think I I shared or or I don't know. If they did that, or just mentioned that, like, yeah. Like, that's like it's like, it's basically, like, really cool. To be able to, to have these notes done. Because yeah. I mean, over the years, I I always had this sort of, like, regret afterwards that I didn't take more notes during the meet meeting.  Me: Yeah.  Them: But the the problem is that at that point, you cannot go back. The nice thing is that like, even if I don't take notes, still just kind of scribble something afterwards, but but the transcript is there anyway. So this this sort of like Like, I do not like this time capsule, and time travel sort of functionality for the transcript can be like real lifesaver. And then and then yeah. So I mean, I'm not sure if if Cinan  Me: That makes a lot of sense.  Them: not using it much, but, like, said, like, straight away, like,  Me: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  Them: got to, like, fully onboard.  Me: Looks like you used it a few times last day last few days. Yeah. Yeah. What what, When you share the notes, I'm curious, how did you share them? What did that about? Was that like copy pasting the notes out of Granola putting them in Slack or email or or something like that. But  Them: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Copying the the notes  Me: Mhmm.  Them: into Slack and then including the the bottom with the link. Which is, I think, a great, like, piece to Like, to show people straight away, like, okay. Once they click on it, they see, oh, I see. So there's this tool and it's from that and that sort of stuff. So think that's an amazing kind of, like, virality, like, feature.  Me: Yeah. How how would you describe what the link does?  Them: But, I mean, it it it physically gives access to the full notes, but then again, like, there's the ask granular on the site. Which which I think for for people are like, oh, wait. Wow. This is amazing.  Me: Mhmm. Yeah. We we we we have a problem with the users copying all of the notes except the link quite a So we're gonna we're gonna figure out how to make it  Them: Alright.  Me: I don't know. Communicate the value a little bit more or something like that. Yeah. Make it more useful though. I don't know exactly. But  Them: I mean, I mean, though those people are not lazy enough. I just click on the copy text  Me: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Nice. I We we're interested I guess, like every starter, you know, we want we want our product to be able to grow virally with a note. Within a company as much as possible. So, like, we're interested in, like, how to make the sharing easier, more more natural, that kind of thing. 1 once all we have is, like, we give you a button in the app that sends it to a sends a note to a Slack Daniel. Like, in one click, I'm I'm curious how that sounds. T or if you just, like, I don't know, nuance there or or things that wouldn't work for you.  Them: Yeah. I mean, I I would probably want to choose on each occasion, like, which channel or which, like, kind of, like, maybe even more just like a private Like, Demmel should it go? So depending on who was in the meeting, there would be, like, various levels of like, confidentiality, I guess. So good good  Me: Yeah.  Them: differ so I guess so there's one that is like, a a com company by Standoff, but everyone is there anyway. That's type Just check it in a channel. But then the other other end is if it's like 1 to 1 with, with someone, then then I would only want to share. So I guess an important bit there is like, it wouldn't always be the same same channel But but yeah. I mean, I I think well, I guess if then the way that's get gets shared in Slack has something over just pasting the text in. So if there are some sort of like interesting features in there. So say, for example, if somehow you managed to integrate into Slack as like a Slack integration like the ask Granola or something like that. Then I think people would be more likely to do it.  Me: That's an interesting idea.  Them: So basically, like, you share it into Slack and then it it's better than if you just paste it in in as text.  Me: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  Them: I think that Have a lot.  Me: That's interesting. Yeah. And I wonder if you could, like, reply to the thread with a question and then somehow agree on the bot. Response in in Slack or something.  Them: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you can build some kind of basic UI. In in Granola with, like, text input boxes and buttons and all that sort of stuff.  Me: Interesting.  Them: So It should be possible.  Me: Interesting. Cool. I got a Nice. We're we're out of time. I, anything else, anything else on your mind, I guess, that we could do to make it better?  Them: Hello? I think I think that was it. I shared all these, like, little UI things. But, yeah, so the main thing me was this, like, expand 1, Make most important topics.  Me: Okay. Okay. Cool. Yeah. We'll we'll explore that because that that that comes up a fair bit. You're, like, your example you talked about was really helpful because I think it makes it more tangible, like, what, like, what we could do to make it better. So nice. Nice. Well, let me know if I can be helpful to you anytime. It it's been really really great for us. Bye.  Them: Hi. Will do.  Me: Yeah. And I Take your time.  Them: I think that my  Me: Yeah. `,

  ## Additional Points
  
  -   Emphasized the importance of being able to highlight or pick the most critical parts of the conversation for more detailed notes.
  -   Mentioned a recent use case where the meeting discussion became input for a product one-pager or ADR, highlighting the importance of detailed documentation and referencing decisions.
  -   Discussed the possibility of a Slack integration that goes beyond simply pasting text, such as incorporating Ask Granola directly into Slack for added functionality.

      summary2: `## Feedback on Granola
  
  -   Daniel finds Granola really useful, especially since he doesn’t have a great memory
  -   Daniel has been doing some evangelism and got his colleagues Seb and Sinan to start using Granola
  -   Daniel shared notes from a chat they all participated in, and “people always appreciate the note-taker”
  -   Daniel mentioned that over the years, he always regretted not taking more notes during meetings, but with Granola, even if he doesn’t take notes, the transcript is there like a “time travel” functionality
  
  Expanding on Important Sections
  
  -   Daniel wanted to be able to expand on a specific section where more detail would be useful
  -   In a workshop, there was lots of general discussion, but towards the end, they identified 3 things they really wanted to build and went into detail
  -   Daniel would like to be able to expand certain sections, like “oh yeah, that was the really important bit”
  -   This would be useful for turning the meeting into a document that the team will work on, like a product spec or description
  
  Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)
  
  -   ADRs are a really useful document that captures the different alternatives considered and why certain decisions were made
  -   Daniel mentioned a scenario where he did the workshop and took the notes, and then Seb needed to make a spec
  -   Being able to extract the conversation into an ADR is “super valuable” for referring back to later, especially if people leave the company or knowledge fades over time
  
  Sharing Notes
  
  -   Daniel shared the notes by copying them into Slack and including the link at the bottom
  -   The link gives access to the full notes and prompts people to “ask Granola,” which Daniel thinks is an amazing virality feature
  -   Daniel would want to choose which channel or DM to share the notes in, depending on who was in the meeting and the level of confidentiality
  -   Daniel suggested that a Slack integration with “ask Granola” functionality could make sharing the notes more valuable than just pasting the text
  
  UI Feedback
  
  -   If you press the zoom in button at the bottom, it always goes down and some bits might be cut off
  -   Daniel didn’t initially notice the zoom in feature, so it may be a bit hidden

      transcript: `Me: Oh, excuse me.  Them: Hey.  Me: Hey, Maggie.  Them: Yep.  Me: You doing? K. Can you can you still hear me now? I just changed speakers.  Them: Hey, Chris.  Me: When I I'm I maybe hear a little bit  Them: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Sorry.  Me: you doing?  Them: Pretty good. I'm just turning granola on.  Me: Nice. Nice.  Them: Yeah.  Me: So, yeah. Us, how's how's it been?  Them: Next. I've been using it both for personal and for work stuff. So I've been doing, like, user interviews with it, which is really helpful. Because usually, I would be, like, desperately trying to type out notes while the person's talking or, like, using the prototype. And it was really nice that I just didn't have to worry about that. So since that that was great. I also used it for I have a design adviser who did, like, a a design crit with me last week, and then it was super useful for that because he was saying a thousand things that were, like, definitely correct. And I was, like, was so glad I didn't have to try to take notes the entire time. But then the thing was, Granola summary wasn't as helpful as the transcript. Like, what I ended up doing afterwards  Me: Yeah. Okay.  Them: was I just wanted like, the notes were okay as, like, a overview. Ought then I was opened up that tiny transcript window and scrolled through the entire thing while taking notes on the side of my own because, like, the things I needed to capture from it I could only get by reading the raw transcript and, like, wasn't enough to, like, do the, like, view transcript thing inside Granola notes?  Me: Okay. Interesting. Ought Sam, What was it about the notes that wasn't wasn't, good enough?  Them: They want that accurate to, like, what had been said. And there were things that were really important that weren't in the notes. Which maybe it was Ought, like, the the conversation was maybe chaotic or, like, Granola might trouble understanding it because we were screen sharing and looking at a Figma file, Right? And, like, referencing things  Me: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  Them: as we talked so it just said generic things like, oh, like, think about putting a sidebar in or something, which which was, you know, not that helpful, but, like, I needed to get into the transcript and be like, okay.  Me: Yeah.  Them: Specifically, what was he suggesting we, like, do for the sidebar interaction or something?  Me: Yeah. Yeah. Like, the new one's really matters for those kind of  Them: Yes. Yeah. Yeah. So I was really relieved to have the transcript  Me: Points.  Them: again. Like, I Like, it was super important to be able to go back and, like, review all the stuff and actually catch it and then be able to, like, take action based off that. But I was frustrated that I only have this tiny tiny window. I just needed a screen that was show me the full transcript.  Me: Got it. Interesting. Interesting. Did you did you play with the, the chat at all? And asking for stuff that way?  Them: Yeah. I did a bit, but, again, it always felt generic This is maybe just, like, my beef with, like, language models at the moment anyway. It's, like, no matter what, it's it's not gonna take the exact notes I need to take from the conversation. I know other people feel differently. They're just, like, fine with whatever language one will spit Ought, but I'm still, like, Not that confident. They're very useful as accurate summarizes, I guess. Or at least for things that really matter to me. When it's like a user interview, I'm like, sure. Sure. Sure. Kat the fact they were, like, you know, a PhD in in physics or whatever, like, not that complex to capture. But for really important conversations, I want the fine Granola details and then I want my interpretation in my notes.  Me: Thanks a lot of sense. Nice. Okay. Cool. Did did you, did you write any notes? During these these sessions, we'll  Them: Yes. Yeah. I usually would be, like,  Me: Yeah.  Them: writing notes out, and then I like that it would, like, integrate those into its It's like overall notes that did that did seem to work well. I sometimes found, like, when I would take more notes, it was unable to sort of make sense of them or it didn't integrate them very well. It just sort of left my notes as is, and then Almost made them worse in a way because I was taking such quick notes. Just like, keywords of what I thought it was sort of, like, filled in stuff around them, but on one call, when I took lots of notes, it didn't add that much to them. I just sort of left my notes as as think, because I couldn't figure out, like, how it related to the transcript or something. So that's where I was like, well, I want like, the summary that Granola gives me know, integrated with my notes. But then I also want the transcript. It was that I still wanted that, like, detailed breakdown of exactly what was said at what moment.  Me: Yeah. Okay. Last night. Cool. How how was it when you first got started figuring stuff Ought, How did that feel?  Them: Pretty easy. I mean, I don't know if I've, like, discovered every pizza, like, but I found, like, the little pop out sidebar right with the chat. It took me a while to figure out that the chat thing was at the bottom. Like, I saw the, like, q and a or, like, get action item stuff at the top, which I tried, but I just didn't have any conversation because those felt very useful. Ought then it took me a while to figure out the the chat thing at the bottom.  Me: Okay. Okay. That makes sense.  Them: Yeah. Pretty yeah. That was very easy.  Me: Makes sense. Nice. And you I mean, you were taking notes, so you You got to the point of taking notes like, figuring out that that was a thing you could do. During living in  Them: Yeah. Like, even without the your intro video was broken, it was pretty easy to figure it out. It's like, cool. This is like a note taking space. Like, I'm gonna type notes here. The little, like, animated green thing makes it obvious it's, like, listening or trying transcribing, which is helpful. It all seems pretty straightforward. I like that it saves notes. I already have fields that I'm gonna lose some of the notes because some of them I'm like, okay. On the main page, I, like, can see historically comment. That's great. Part of me Ought is going like, oh, where are those stored? Like, are they gonna get deleted at some point? Like, should I copy these out? Sooner? Like, will these disappear if I leave them for a month? So there's just some of that, like, anxiety.  Me: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That makes sense. Could I get them out if grandma dies? That kind that kind of thing.  Them: Yeah.  Me: Get Yeah.  Them: Yeah. Pretty much. Yeah.  Me: Cool. Cool.  Them: Yeah. Yeah.  Me: The so it sounds like the main thing is, like, the note. The quality of the notes isn't great hasn't been great for you. And they probably need to be way more Way more concrete and specific. At a mountain.  Them: Yep. And I think I I would always need to see the transcript some point. Like, you have these little preview windows at the moment, but I'm like, no matter the quality of the note, I'm gonna want a screen where I can see that full transcript.  Me: Mhmm.  Them: Just just because there will be some part of the conversation that, like, for me is important. A language model would never understand why it was Appleton, but, like,  Me: Okay. Yeah.  Them: I'll need to go scroll through and find is why it's  Me: Yeah. Nice. Yeah. I agree I agree that, like, the transcript in that little window, it feels very transitory. And think when when we did that, we were like, trying those people away from using it. The despite doing that, people still want it a lot. I don't know. Like, it it does seem like a pretty key thing. Yeah.  Them: Yeah. Right. It's like the raw material. And especially now, How you know, not fully trusting the language model summaries, you just go like, well, you know, the the notes say that this was mentioned, but, like, I don't really remember that Part or, like, I'm afraid there's a bunch of content in the transcript that hasn't been transferred to the notes, which has been the case. It's like,  Me: Yeah.  Them: I read the transcript, I'm like, oh, yeah. That's nowhere in the notes, but, like, that's an important point.  Me: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Makes sense. Makes sense. What so 11 I think one obvious reason why the notes aren't There's probably a bunch of reasons, but like one, big one is just that we constrain the lengths to keep them quite quite  Them: Yeah.  Me: You know,  Them: Yeah.  Me: like, not an insane length. How I don't know. How do you how do you feel about the length  Them: Maggie.  Me: would you feel about different lengths? Like, is would it better for you if it was just way way longer? If we let it run And let it go into way more detail. Or  Them: I think I'd usually want more detail. Like, from all the summaries I've seen, I go through and, like, add more detail to them or, like, flush them out more. It's yeah. It's one of those also. Like, it depends on the context when it's just like the half an hour user interview and they haven't said that much, I'm like, okay. You know? Capture who they were and what they thought about the prototype. But for, like, the longer hour long calls where talking to someone we're just, like, comparing notes or doing design crits. Like, I want as much detail as possible. Yeah.  Me: Yeah. Yeah. Makes sense. Yeah. We don't respond to the length of the call at at the moment too. Like, if you have a 15 minute call or a hour call, the notes are the same length, which  Them: Okay.  Me: It's Yeah. Where this is now?  Them: Yeah. Yeah.  Me: How have you been using the notes? Or I don't know, just just I guess even if you've been writing your own app and just looking at a transcript, like, what what do you end up doing with those?  Them: Well, for important meetings, I'm gonna take notes, I'm gonna go off. I then will take notes. I move them over to Tano, which is my main note taking workspace. And then some of those, like, get turned into to dos and to do list. So they just kinda, like, go out into the rest of my system. Like, I'm definitely seeing granola as, like, a transitory area where they kinda pass through where. Like, I just need to get the main points out of the notes of the transcript, and then they go either into Notion if it's something for work. Like, we write up our user interviews now or into Tanya if it's, like, some personal thing.  Me: Nice. So you have, like, a a user interview repository or something in Notion that  Them: Yeah. Yeah. But I usually had to before I was  Me: Did then Nice. Yeah. Okay.  Them: during the call, like, frantically typing up notes while talking to the person and trying to show them the prototype. And then afterwards, we'd, like, have to go through those and try to remember everything right afterwards. And then, like, write a summary and post that to Slack. It's, like, my mutual process.  Me: Mhmm.  Them: But it was really nice to not like, to have my attention less split in an interview because I And I'm okay. This is one of these. I'm sure you know about this. So you're sort of like a secret feature that, like, is a little, morally gray or something. But the fact they don't have to ask permission to, like, record the Zoom call and, like, granola silently transcribes in the background, and I'm like, well, I'm not gonna use these notes for anyone but me, you know. They're not going anywhere. But it is slightly nicer to not have to ask permission even though technically I should be. On every call, knowing that it's transcribed without having to make this, like, awkward. Like, okay. Now do you give consent for us to, like, record this? Which I do with users. But when I'm just talking to someone off Twitter and we're just, like, maybe sharing, like, insider information and it's all in confidence, they would not be okay with me recording that. But it's nice that I can kind of secretly with granola transcribe it, just for my own notes, but, like,  Me: Yeah.  Them: that helps a lot.  Me: Yeah. Yeah.  Them: I don't know if that's a feature you could, like, sell to people. Like, you can secretly record with granola, and they won't know.  Me: It's like a line we gotta figure out how to walk. Yeah. Definitely. Like,  Them: Yeah.  Me: and that it  Them: Yeah.  Me: Yeah. People really like that about using granola. But, like, we probably need to we probably do need to, like, step a few more steps towards, like, a encouraging you to either disclose that you're using or just have a really subtle way of, like,  Them: Yeah.  Me: subtly making someone aware without having to, like, stop the call at the beginning and be like, you know, Can I  Them: Yeah. Yeah.  Me: sent to do this thing? Yeah.  Them: Because Zoom makes it very awkward. Right? And then it announces, like, this call is being recorded,  Me: Ought.  Them: and it's very, like,  Me: Yeah. Yeah.  Them: I feel like people say less after that point.  Me: Yeah. Yeah.  Them: Yeah.  Me: Yeah. 11  Them: Yeah.  Me: so you you you got a talk.  Them: I was I was gonna say I also used it to interview someone for, like, a potential designer we might be hiring, and that was also really helpful. I think the notes on that one were longer and better for some reason. Oh, this is where I think I took lots more notes, and then it, like, organized them categories for me. But again, that was helpful because I, like, did the interview. It was, like, Friday night, closed my laptop, like, didn't open up until Saturday morning. And then was able to, like, use the categories to type stuff up in Greenhouse. So, like, it did a good job when I wrote lots of notes of grouping them for me. And that one, I didn't have to, like, look back at the transcript as much. That one was good.  Me: Nice. Nice. Cool. Yeah. We have a prompt where if you hit a threshold of enough notes, And is a different prompt. It's like it it, it Ought, organizes where you work and adds a few a few things you messed rather than trying to write the whole thing. So That's interesting. And that  Them: Yeah. I can tell you're trying to do this with the, like, templates. I haven't really used them much, but, like,  Me: Yeah. Yeah.  Them: different call types. I have I'd have want different things for the notes.  Me: Yeah. Big time. Big time. That that example is really interesting. Did you like when when you had that call and you took lots of notes, did you find yourself going back to the transcript then as well, or did you kinda trust that I I've written is is Ought. Like, it's there, kinda thing.  Them: Yeah. I think this one was more helpful in that because the design was presenting to me, I didn't have to say much. It was just sort of, like, they were screen sharing and walking me to their portfolio. So I kinda had freedom to, like, actually actually type all my thoughts at the time, and, like, comment on their visual design skills and stuff like that. So I ended up with this big chunk of notes and then it helped kinda organize them for me. And I I don't think I actually even had to look at the transcript at all for that one, which is very different to when I'm having to talk to someone or interview them or, like, I just don't have the brain capacity capacity spare to, like, be writing stuff.  Me: Interesting. And you still so you did that interview and you still when you went to Greenhouse, talk me through what you did there. You you you then went and rode up rewrote the notes in Greenhouse.  Them: Yeah. I think just because in our when we're doing hiring, we have, like, a pretty strict format for how we report back on interviews. It's like you write pros, cons, and then, like, anything else miscellaneous, but you're trying to keep it quite short and, like, objective. So my notes would have been filled with these, like, maybe subjective vibes or something. Like, oh, it seems like they were a bit confused here. It seems like they didn't have Good. And then I kinda have to translate that into a much more concise, condensed thing into greenhouse. I kinda need the intermediate notes to figure out like, what I thought and then, like, you know, question, is that a legitimate know, judgment? Am I just, like, assuming things that weren't actually said or done in the interview? That kind of stuff.  Me: Ought Sam So would you One thought there is that we could, like, think You you could have a Granola template that was The structure that you have for hiring this designer, you know, like, the headings or whatever. And Granola could take a shot at, like, filling out under those headings. But I'm curious if that would Like, that feel good to you? Or do you think you would still wanna, like, have a lot of control over what what goes in there and Changing what's you know, make sure it's from you, I guess.  Them: Yeah. Interesting. You could take a shot of it, and then I could edit it, I guess. But maybe this is why I have a little too much skepticism with the accuracy of stuff, but they worry so much about whenever I ask language models for things. And they give me a plausible sounding answer, and I'm like, oh, that's probably right. And then I realized, like, well, I didn't write that. So, like, I have no reason to believe any of these points are really valid. Like, this is a little too much. Skepticism around like, you know, oh, wouldn't it be nice if, you know, this had just, like, made this judgment on this person for me, but, like,  Me: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  Them: I get a little too, like, oh, I I feel like I should have write it myself or decide that myself.  Me: Yeah. We don't wanna be in the business of making judgments for you or anything.  Them: Yeah. Yeah. But but if it could take a pause at it, maybe. I there's something in here about I'm sure you've thought about, like, I almost don't want one canonical version of the notes because my notes always go through multiple multiple versions. Right? There's, like, raw transcript, like, maybe messy notes where I'm like, thinking out loud or, like, random share I type on the call. And then there's, like, could be various versions of the cleaned up notes. I almost want this to be, like, Show me, you know, more detail to less detail, but the less detail can have many different versions of it.  Me: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Depending on, like, where it's gonna I'm just gonna read it.  Them: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Like, I guess when I'm maybe when I'm drafting essays, right, or, like, note taking, there are sort of I'm doing it under bullet points, but, like, I'll do one pass at, like, a really, you know, long, messy, you know, spoken version, and then you do another pass is that, but, like, condensed down, and you're just, like, distilling, distilling, distilling. And I I mean, that's kind of what you're trying to do with granola a bit. Right? It's, like, distill through multiple rounds. I don't think the rounds fit is, like, as explicit at the moment. There's, like, only one version of the notes in the end.  Me: Yeah. Cool. That's fascinating. We've, like, we've, like, a explored a bunch of these I did before and dropped some of them before. Already, and, like, it's interesting that he like it. Then that could yeah, that's still a thing. Yeah. But Yeah.  Them: Yeah. Well, I've I don't know. The other users think Ought isn't most of the other people you're talking to, like, VCs or consultants or people doing  Me: Yeah. Mostly.  Them: and lots of interviews? So, like, I assume they have different  Me: Yeah. Yeah. You're definitely, I think, in the,  Them: use cases for it. Yeah.  Me: I sense that you care more about the output then then a lot of people. Like Sam. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  Them: Yeah. It depends on the call, Ought, yeah, like, when it's, like, a really important call, like, the output needs to be very information dense, but concise. Yep.  Me: Yeah. What I'm I I presume you have folks at illicit doing sales, business development,  Them: Yep.  Me: talking to potential customers, that kind of thing. I'm curious  Them: Yeah.  Me: What would it take for you to recommend granola to them? Wholeheartedly for what  Them: I mean, they could certainly try it out. We already use  Me: for what you do. Or for for what they do.  Them: Zoom recordings, and they're, like, weird. I don't even know if we use the transcript frankly. They all get uploaded to, like, Zoom's cloud interface, and no one can ever access again. So I can probably just recommend this to Jing Wan, one of our cofounders sales at the moment, with, like, big pharma companies or, like, universities. So he's talking to lots of people. Could probably just send it send the link to her and get her to try it. See if it's useful. And because she just goes through a lot, and I don't think that  Me: Yeah.  Them: would matter that much. I'm not really sure.  Me: Oh, interesting.  Them: Yeah.  Me: Yeah. That'd be great. That'd be great. I'm I'm curious. So, like, any doubts or any, like, anything where you're like, I don't know if it went to her or or not about this or  Them: It seems pretty low risk. It's one of those where, like, if it gives you a summary of notes and you're like, oh, this isn't quite capturing some of the things that were said. That's where being able to see the transcript and, like, go back and capture that is important. But apart from that, it's like there's nothing negative or, like, risky in doing it, I guess. It just seems like an, like, low level net benefit to go, like, who this thing is, like, transcribing in the background, It's gonna attempt to summarize for me. That summary, like, might be of questionable quality. But, like, the raw transcript itself is, like, pretty high value.  Me: Cool. Okay. Cool. That's helpful. What what I'm we were to do one thing next to make this better for you, I'm assuming it's around the notes transcript.  Them: Yeah.  Me: What would that would that be, do you think?  Them: Yeah. I feel like you will still have some real estate to play with here because it's just a nice simple notes thing. Like, being able to make that transcript visible and readable. I'm trying to think of, like, in the in the in the interview where I wrote tons of notes and then put them into categories for me. I like the categories. There's something in here about, like, could you color code the transcript to, like, show me where certain themes were mentioned? Like, the the really important design quick call I had, there were certain themes that we kept coming back to and, like, over the course of an hour, like, showed up 3 or 4 times, but in different sections. And it's something like, okay. Show me everywhere we talked about confusing information architect something in, like, point me to those sections. But, again, it's so that I can write notes on it versus granola writing notes for me.  Me: Mhmm.  Them: Although yeah. Maybe this is where q and a would come and be able to say that's okay. Show me all the places and then you collect them. But I want Maggie it to do that for me. Like, I want it to organize the  Me: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  Them: transcript for me more than write notes for me, if that makes sense.  Me: Cool. Like, being able to let you navigate like, kind of feel at a like, zoom down level the transcripts and that you find the bits that you're looking for and  Them: Yeah. Maybe this is just a new theme. I'm on where I'm like, getting more and more skeptical of, like, purely generated stuff with language models and more interested in how could put, like, semantic lenses over existing content with them. So, like, if you have a whole transcript, could you find ways to, like, create groupings in those trans that transcript will help me, like, skim it really quickly or, like, read it in a way that's more efficient so that I'm still getting the core material or, like, the raw material from humans, Ought helping me interpret it versus, like, hiding it and then, like, rewriting everything for me.  Me: Interesting. Interesting. Cool. Alright. That's really helpful.  Them: Cool. Cool.  Me: This is great.  Them: Yep.  Me: What how how would you describe, like, if you if you were was it John John 1?  Them: Don't know. I just feel like, well, it  Me: The the person you how would you describe it to them if you were to to be like, hey, John Wan. You should check out this thing.  Them: transcribes and, like, takes notes for you. And then just let her try it. She's usually pretty pretty willing to, like, experiment. I don't know. It seems it's again, like, it seems like a pretty simple value prop. Like, just helps you take calls in the background. I mean, cool notes in the background.  Me: Yeah.  Them: Yeah.  Me: Yeah. Do you have any questions? Megan, maybe maybe I answered this already, but, like, for you personally, what are the most common meeting archetypes that you wish granola did a great job at?  Them: 1 on ones. And then it's kinda like capturing, like, what are we taught what topics or, like, projects that we talk about and maybe action items, although there's more rare. User interviews are the majority of what I've been using it for.  Me: Yeah.  Them: Super helpful there. Just kinda, like, captures the basics. It lets me type up notes faster. And then, like, design crits, and then I've also been using it for just kind of, like, 1 on 1 calls with people off Twitter, like other people who are working as language model designers or trying to do, like, interesting software stuff, and it's more of, like, us comparing notes on, like, how we're trying to solve problems and that kind of thing.  Me: And when you went through onboarding, did you choose, the generalist  Them: Yeah.  Me: option for, like, your user profile? Okay.  Them: Yeah.  Me: And I guess the question I have is I you send when you took a lot of notes, it kinda did worse. Can you tell that? Right?  Them: It was worse  Me: No. She said worse, didn't she?  Them: at it didn't really add much to my notes. Like, it would organize them into categories, but it didn't add much to them.  Me: Ought.  Them: So then what I just had was, like, my kind of chaotic raw notes, like, grouped into themes. But it wasn't, like, summarizing the call for me as much as it does when I don't take any notes. Right.  Me: Ought. Okay. So what I'm hearing is on one hand, you don't trust the output of the language model. So you for the calls, you really care about the content. You actually went through the transcript and, like, took notes.  Them: Yep.  Me: But when you took a lot of notes, you didn't like that it didn't add a bunch of stuff. Ought.  Them: Kind of. I was just kind of, like, it took My bad notes, because I think when I was taking notes on calls, I'm usually quite, like,  Me: Yeah.  Them: distracted or Ought, like, And I just took those and, like, didn't flush them out or make them more coherent.  Me: I guess the last question would be, like,  Them: Based on the transcript.  Me: if we could give you a lot more control over the shape of the generated notes, What how would you like to exercise that control?  Them: I don't know. Maybe I'm too skeptical that it could really do a good job of it because I'm thinking Like, okay. The design crits I do, could I give it the the notes that I take? My, like, very carefully typed Ought, like, okay. We've broken this down into that there were 3 main problems that were mentioned, and here's, like, the outline of those problems like, why they matter. Like, if I fed it some examples and then sort of fine tuned it on those, maybe it would do I don't know it would do a better job, but that's, like, worth trying out or something is in my mind. Like, I think I don't know if how you have, like, defining templates at the moment, but I assume you, like, just write a prompt  Me: Mhmm.  Them: for it to, like, have a new template? Ought, like, feeding in examples of the kind of notes you want as output seems like more likely to lead to good results is what I would imagine.  Me: Right. So so I'm asking how you'd like to exercise control. So, like, what I'm hearing is you'd like To redefine a template. Is that, like, a a priori define a template? Is that Is that what you mean?  Them: If it was easy yeah. It went on when I'm like, okay. There's a bunch of meeting types I do regularly, like user interviews, hiring interviews. If I give it examples, I don't wanna tell it what I want. It's a bit like the declarative and the other one, something programming where you, like, describe what you're gonna do versus describing the output. Forget. There's 2 ones. But, like,  Me: I think  Them: don't wanna tell it what to do. I wanna to show it what I want as an output and have it, like,  Me: Yeah.  Them: make all further outputs based on that.  Me: Okay. That makes sense. Like, you spent time you spent a much time previously writing good user interview notes. That you're happy with and you want  Them: Yeah.  Me: you want more of these with less effort.  Them: Yeah. There's, like, a set format.  Me: Like,  Them: It's always like, okay. Profile per person, like, feedback on the prototype, like, complaints about illicit. Like, there's, like,  Me: Nice.  Them: categories, and it's just fill those in.  Me: Have you found the, Template editor. Thing, it's it's hidden. It's very hidden.  Them: MSC. Ought, wait. Now I'm in a meeting, so I cannot find it. Hold on.  Me: You might be I'd be curious to see how it's hit how where it hits and where it misses because I'm  Them: Oh, wait. Okay. Wait. Enhance notes. Okay. I got this. My templates. All templates. Oh, okay. I had seen the screen. Create template. Okay. I hadn't actually clicked on that. Oh, give granola overview of the meeting and your goals for it and sections. Oh, okay. Cool. Okay. This would be useful. I did not Minus Ought because I was being a standard user and not clicking buttons. Like, I saw the template thing, and then just, like, closed it and was like, cool. They're templates anyway. Back to what I was doing.  Me: sure it'll miss in a bunch of ways. Mhmm. Like, Yeah. How are you using it for personal and for work?  Them: Okay. So on my laptop, I have 2 users, and one is like, my personal and one is my work. So I just log in and out of them every time I wanna switch context. And so I have been all installed on both, but with different email addresses. So all my work stuff is in 1 and all my personal stuff in the other. Well, that's great.  Me: That's very cool. Awesome. Thank you so much, Maggie.  Them: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No problem. Alright. Hopefully, see you guys soon.  Me: Bye.  Them: Right. `,

      summary1: `**Takeaways**
  
  -   Notes are too high level and not concrete enough
  -   Notes miss the points that are important her
  
  ## First Impressions
  
  -   How she’s using it
  -   What’s she using the notes for?
  
  ## Usage and Feedback
  
  -   Useful for design advisor, so glad to not have to take notes
  -   Granola’s summary not as helpful as the transcript
  -   Scrolled through the transcript
  -   Notes weren’t that accurate; nuance really matters
  -   Frustrated by tiny transcript window
  -   Chat felt generic; not confident in AI summaries
  -   Liked that it integrated notes into its overall notes
  -   When I took more notes, it didn’t integrate them well
  
  ## Onboarding and Discoverability
  
  -   Took a while to see the chat at the bottom - consider moving
  -   Concerned about where notes are stored - are they going to get deleted?
  
  ## Needs and Preferences
  
  -   Wants a screen to see full transcript
  -   Usually wants more detail, especially for hour-long calls
  -   Moves notes to Tana; Granola seen as a transitory area
  -   Uses Notion for work, like user interviews
  
  ## Recording and Permissions
  
  -   It’s nice to not have to ask permission for recording; useful for confidential conversations
  
  ## Different Uses
  
  -   Designer interview - notes were better when it wrote lots of notes
  -   Trusted her own notes more than AI
  -   Hiring involves a strict, concise format
  -   Worry about the accuracy of interview notes; doesn’t trust accuracy
  -   Doesn’t want one canonical version of the notes; prefers multiple versions
  
  ## Potential Recommendation
  
  -   Could recommend Granola; seems low risk
  -   Important to be able to make the transcript visible and readable
  -   Suggests color-coding the transcript to find themes
  
  ## Describing Granola
  
  -   Granola “transcribes and takes notes for you”
  
  ## Meeting Types
  
  -   1 on 1s - projects, action items
  -   User interviews

  ## Notes Improvement
  
  -   When I wrote a lot, it took my bad notes and categorized them
  -   Wants to give Granola examples of the notes she wants
  
  ## Additional Points
  
  -   Acknowledged difficulty in capturing complex design feedback using AI summaries.
  -   Expressed the need for a detailed breakdown of conversations for actionables.
  -   Highlighted the value of being able to navigate and zoom into the transcript for specific details.
  -   Suggested the potential for Granola to group transcript themes for efficient reading.
  -   Interested in Granola’s ability to apply “semantic lenses” over content rather than generate new content.
  -   Discussed the varying needs for notes depending on the type of call.
  -   Suggested using examples of good notes as templates for Granola to emulate.
  -   Interested in a feature to predefine templates for consistent note-taking across similar meeting types.

      summary2: `## First Impressions
  
  -   Maggie found Granola easy to figure out and use
  -   Took a while to see the chat at the bottom - consider moving it
  -   Liked that it integrated her notes into its overall notes
  
  ## Using Granola
  
  -   Maggie is using Granola for both personal and work stuff
  -   Finds it useful for design advisor meetings
  -   So glad to not have to take notes during calls
  -   Frustrated that Granola’s summary was not as helpful as the transcript
  -   Scrolled through the transcript because summaries weren’t accurate enough
  -   Wants a screen to see the full transcript, especially for hour-long calls
  -   Moves notes from Granola (transitory area) to Tana or Notion
  -   Likes not having to ask for permission to record, especially for confidential calls
  
  ## Meeting Types
  
  -   1-on-1s: projects, action items
  -   User interviews
  -   Design crits
  -   1-on-1 calls with interesting people
  
  ## Feedback and Suggestions
  
  -   When Maggie wrote a lot of notes, Granola just categorized her “bad notes”
  -   Wants to give Granola examples of the types of notes she wants as output
  -   Doesn’t want one canonical version of notes, needs multiple versions
  -   Could recommend Granola to others, seems low risk
  -   Wants ability to make transcript visible and readable
  -   Suggests color coding transcript to find themes
  -   Describes Granola as “transcribes and takes notes for you”

      transcript: ` Them: Hi.  Me: Hey.  Them: Okay. I am on Grinnell now.  Me: Hi, Jeff. K. K. K. Yeah.  Them: And I do have some feedback. So yes, success. Yes.  Me: Excellent.  Them: Good. So there are a couple of things. I really like it. I I really like the fact that you don't need to, like, log it in as an extra client. It's great. Okay. And I'm gonna go now into the things that I like to experience. I but I do like it. I do really say that. So first thing is, I had a meeting. It started. I stopped the meeting. Meeting was scheduled to be in, like, 45 minutes, and we stopped the meeting after 10 minutes in. It continued recording. And I only caught it continuing recording for another 20 minutes.  Me: Mhmm.  Them: So I think that might be because the calendar was scheduled in that way.  Me: Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. It'll stop if you're within, like, I think we said it. Like, if you're 10 minutes before the end of the meeting, then it'll it'll cut it off. But yeah, you're right. It it wouldn't do a good job then. Okay. That's  Them: Yeah. So that was one thing. I had a that same meeting  Me: a good case out of mind.  Them: I then rescheduled for later. And then I think it's because it was the same meeting from before, but it was rescheduled. It no longer knew to enter into that meeting.  Me: Okay.  Them: Yes.  Me: Okay. Interesting. So you'd, like, already done the meeting? But then you like, reschedule it again for later. And Yeah. Okay. Okay. What would you, and that that's an interesting case. What what what would you have wanted to what in your mind, was that, like, a separate meeting, the one that you had later, or was it, like, would you want I don't know. Continue the same note?  Them: I would have been happy with either.  Me: Continue, like, make it the same thing.  Them: In I don't know what other cases could occur. But in my particular case, someone had, like, people wants to go for lunch. So we started a meeting with, like, oh, no. You know what? Let's just all go for lunch and then have the meeting later. So it was literally a really quick meeting and then rescheduled for later. So for me, I would have made sense for it to be in the same note,  Me: Okay.  Them: I think normally if I  Me: Yeah.  Them: feel like it's gonna be a different meeting, I'll just set up a new meeting. The reason why I rescheduled that is because it didn't really happen. So I just moved the time So, yeah, I think what I would have been happy with it opening the same night but, I would have also equally been happy if I created a new unit. I wouldn't have cared too much. Okay.  Me: Makes sense. Makes sense.  Them: That's the 2 main things.  Me: Cool. Alright. That's mhmm.  Them: I think, that I've experienced as bugs so far. The other the other thing is if you create a Huddl  Me: Nice.  Them: Slack. It doesn't Start recording. Doesn't open a new note in  Me: Mhmm.  Them: start recording. When that happens. But if I do open a new note, it's gonna start recording Yes.  Me: Yeah.  Them: So I guess I need to manually do that. It could be quite cool if we were to just create a new night the moment it realizes I'm in a meeting.  Me: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's a good chat. We, yeah, it has we have, like, the know if you noticed it or not. They're, like, black, the g icon with the little  Them: Yes.  Me: green bouncing bars on the side of your screen. That, like, in theory, that should be popping up. Like, if you start start a Slack Huddl, that should, like, announce itself and be like, hey. Do you wanna take a note here?  Them: Okay.  Me: I'm not sure if that's happening. I don't know. Like, that that's how it was designed, but I whether it's actually  Them: I have it on the side. I  Me: delivering on that, I don't know.  Them: that didn't happen. I don't think.  Me: Yeah.  Them: Didn't see it happen. Because when it happens at the So when it I quite like that it, like, gives you the pop up one  Me: Okay.  Them: one minute before the meeting and tells you to join the meeting with Vala. That's quite nice. Because I received My  Me: Yeah.  Them: calendar also pings 10 minutes before, but sometimes I continue working and then  Me: Yeah.  Them: I'm, like, 3 minutes late just because I forgot there was actually studying. So that's actually quite useful in general that it's, like, 1 minute before the meeting.  Me: Yeah.  Them: That didn't obviously because I started the meeting on Slack.  Me: Mhmm.  Them: Maybe it's because I started it, but if someone wants to be calling me, then I would've picked it up. I'm not sure.  Me: Mhmm.  Them: Yeah.  Me: Maybe maybe.  Them: Cool.  Me: I don't know. Okay. Cool. I'm gonna test that and see if I can I can  Them: And I think that's it. I haven't experienced anything else  Me: did you say?  Them: Yet.  Me: Nice.  Them: Okay. I had a meeting  Me: How have the, how's the notes felt that it's  Them: Good.  Me: created for you so far?  Them: Especially in the beginning. I would say, a meeting that, like, last 15 minutes is really good. A meeting that is 45 minutes, It tends to create quite 15 minutes. And then  Me: Mhmm.  Them: tends to also be quite good. Again, I haven't  Me: Thank  Them: moments have the chat on Tuesday or Wednesday, so I only download it on Thursday. So I haven't used it that long. But Yes. It was, like,  Me: Mhmm.  Them: yeah. I find it useful for stuff that are, like, numbers. Sam things I mean, it's nice that you can, like, go between your normal notes and the actual  Me: Yeah.  Them: script, but sometimes the notes that I write are not really related with what we're talking about in the chat, but actually related and I don't know how you saw that obvious feedback, but, like, the notes that I create would often also be like,  Me: Mhmm.  Them: for me to do something, especially whenever they're internal in the team. So we'll discuss something, and I'll I'll write myself a note saying, I need to think about how we need to rate this. So I need think about how we do this. Which is not connected with, like, actually giving me a summary of the meeting.  Me: Mhmm. Right. Makes sense. What what would you want to happen there? Would you want the the things that you write for yourself to end up in the notes the end, or do you think you think of them as, like, separate things?  Them: I I wonder if there are different types of conversation and different types of notes people take, and maybe there could be, like, Some maybe even, like, classifier figuring out what type it is. So if I go on a meeting to figure out how I need to pay tax,  Me: Mhmm.  Them: or if I go on a meeting with my accountant, It's mostly me asking question. They've been giving me information, and the notes are mostly me writing what they've said, which is I think where granola is amazing, and it's where you guys bring the most value right now. Or, like, things like someone mentioned the ticket sizes they invest in. Right? And I didn't hear exactly what it was, like, numbers and, like, dates and, like, stuff like that is really good because it catches you. But then there are other meetings where And I think those are the type of meetings you have internally, which are much more I need to do this, and I need to sort this out, and I need to and it's more actions for myself. So, like, The it has nothing to do with the meeting I we had. And I'm probably very up to date as to, like, what this meeting was about. So I probably wouldn't need the summarization of the meeting. So it's, like, completely different  Me: Mhmm. Mhmm. Yeah.  Them: The type of notes, if that makes sense.  Me: Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Interesting.  Them: Yes. I would say so.  Me: Has that been mostly internal meetings for you? Like, those those kinda like a  Them: Yes.  Me: yeah.  Them: Not there's a  Me: Interesting. Yeah. I only think about how to do that better. That that I agree that that I have I have a bunch of those too. Right? You used to know that out of habit, but, like, notes just aren't useful because because it's I don't know. I I don't need a summary. Yeah.  Them: Yeah. Cool. Oh,  Me: Cool. One thing one thing you can try, is if you do, like, square brackets, before in the notes. It's a bit like, it's not not a very well thought out feature yet, but if you do square brackets before, no. Make it a to do in the notes. And,  Them: Oh, that's really cool. Okay.  Me: show up. Like, on your home screen, so you can keep track of,  Them: I I will be wait.  Me: things that you you wanted to do. Like,  Them: Where's my Okay. Cool. I think I left the meeting now that we are having. And I came back to it, and I don't think it's recording anymore despite the meeting continuing.  Me: Mhmm.  Them: Because I I don't know what I was trying to go to a different meeting,  Me: Okay.  Them: So tell you about  Me: Infusing.  Them: a different meeting and how I was summarizing it. Now I came back to our meeting, and now now it's not reporting anymore. I haven't done this before. Okay.  Me: That's a pain in the ass  Them: That's Nice. I really like how when you  Me: Okay.  Them: install it in the beginning, and then you enable everything and then the video that you explained the product pops up automatically with the note next to it? Just be cool. Just be cool that it's, like, happening. Yeah.  Me: Mhmm. Cool.  Them: I did. Yeah. I did I did watch the video.  Me: Did you watch the video? I'm curious whether, like, if it if it's  Them: I stopped it because  Me: I don't know, if people actually watch it.  Them: I  Me: Right.  Them: I was there for yeah. I think first, so I kinda knew of what to expect. Yeah. And my cofounder had already downloaded it before that, so  Me: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. K. Cool.  Them: Yeah.  Me: Yeah.  Them: Cool.  Me: Nice. Correct.  Them: Yeah. No worries. Yeah. Hope it was useful.  Me: Cool. That's great. Yeah. Thank you. I I got a good lunch good stuff to go on here. Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. And,  Them: Yes. Absolutely. Will do. Yeah. See you.  Me: send me any feedback anytime if you keep using  Them: Bye.  Me: I gotcha. Yeah. Right. `,

      summary1: `-   Granola didn’t stop recording for her and recorded an extra 20 minutes
  -   Rescheduling a meeting didn’t update the meeting in Granola
      -   Existing notes not linked to the new schedule (Sophia)
  -   She liked the nub, but it didn’t detect a slack huddle for her
  
  ## Note Quality and Usefulness
  
  -   **Duration vs. Detail**
      -   15-minute meetings: notes detailed and useful (Sophia)
      -   45-minute meetings: detail drops in the middle (Sophia)
  -   **Content Specificity**
      -   Granola effectively captures numbers and specific data (Sophia)
      -   Notes written by Sophia often action items for herself, not related to meeting summary
  
  ## Onboarding
  
  -   Liked the video
  -   Found the notification very helpful for remembering the meeting
  
  Granola stopped recording when she pressed ‘back’ out of an active meeting, then returned. Found this confusing
  
  Action items are the most important thing to capture for her and she wasn’t sure how to in Granola

      transcript: ` Them: Hi, Chris. How are you? Nice to meet you.  Me: To meet you. There you are. I can see  Them: That looks like a lovely place  Me: It's, it's actually right outside our office.  Them: wherever you're dialing in from. Okay.  Me: Office. Our our office is is here, and then I'm just kinda standing in the hall. It's a nicer  Them: I  Me: a nice coworking space where we're based in.  Them: Yeah. It looks like a kind of seventies retro LA vibe. I don't know why it's were, like,  Me: I think I think that's accurate. Yeah. Yeah. It's just, I think the architects are from Madrid, and they have this very distinctive style,  Them: Nice. I'm I'm at home in, West London. Yeah. It's work from home day on Fridays, which is  Me: yeah. Where are you calling from? Are you back? Cool.  Them: quite nice.  Me: Yeah. Your your home looks very nice.  Them: Yeah. I mean, I have a stepson, so we we had to kind of it for me, it went from, like, a one bedroom studio to actually needing, like, actual space, which is has been quite interesting. Interesting.  Me: Fair enough. Yeah. How was your stepson? If I if if  Them: He's 10. He's 10. Which  Me: He can.  Them: actually, as a consumer investor, is is becoming quite an interesting time because I get to learn about all these apps and toys and things that older kind of younger cuss like, consumers are are using. So I think it's gonna be  Me: Yeah.  Them: yeah. It's quite interesting now.  Me: Very cool. Well, it's a pleasure to meet you. I've been looking forward to this. Would love to learn a little bit about your journey and you know, what you're looking for, and we can I'll tell you all about granola and see  Them: Great.  Me: know, there's a potential  Them: So, yeah, I I was born in Ukraine, raised in Spain, I guess, quite an international background, and reason I went to LSC to study international relations is I thought I wanted to be a diplomat. Then it turns out I kind of didn't understand what country I would be a diplomat for, and I you know? Ukraine, probably not. Spain, also probably not. And I I realized that, you know, you had to do quite a lot of extra studying. You needed a master's, a PhD, and I was quite keen to just start  Me: Mhmm.  Them: working. I didn't really wanna know, study for the next 10 years. And I started thinking, you know, what do I enjoy? What am I good at? I was quite good at kind of written communication. I'm quite concise, but, you know, I enjoyed all these long form essays as well. So, okay, I'm good at writing. And I really like the fashion industry, but from kind of a it's a trillion multi trillion pound business point of view rather than just  Me: Pretty pretty close.  Them: You know, Well, And at the time, I read Business of Fashion as as a blog, really. It's started as a blog, then eventually it kind of got funding from Index and Felix. Which I think was very small amounts, to be honest. But, yeah, it kind of scaled slowly through the years. And thought, well, I could just be a fashion journalist. So I know, applied to Bof. The email just said, I really think you should hire me. This why they came back and said, please go and do internships. So I I went and did that and long story short, they they hired me to start day 1 after I graduated from LSC. That was 2017. And I joined as a reporter. I covered quite a lot of global markets. So I I traveled to, like, Georgia for fashion week. I traveled to Ukraine. It it was really interesting. Also covered a lot of the d two c kind of brands. So I guess the golden age for them. So I interviewed, you know, the old birds founders, the Glossier founder, and also was interviewing a lot of VCs about kind of what investing trends they were seeing.  Me: Right.  Them: And also becoming quite disillusioned with the with with journalism. I think if if you wanna be a good reporter, you can't see yourself as being anything other than a journalist. And I, you know, I had other interests and I I wasn't really it wasn't really my passion. So I I started thinking, okay. VC could be interesting. But at the time, yeah. COVID kind of hit, so I said, you know, I have to stay here. But I asked them to move me to a more kind of operational role because I I had a great mentor. Our our managing editor was still is really, and I and I said I wanna work with you. And so they moved me to a role in between kind of office of the CEO, editorial marketing products. So really interesting. The most interesting I would say was when we migrated completely our CMS from a very basic one to one that you know, the Washington Post uses. So I had to be on the call with the tech team in Slovenia to manage that and then kind of tell them about what we wanted out of it versus telling the editorial team, like, the  Me: Right. Right. Right.  Them: you have to use it, etcetera. So that was really interesting. And that I did that for about 2 years. So kind of operational. And then yeah, at the time, I was kind of researching VC, and then, you know, I found the Jamjar role and and kind of applied and got it. And I joined 2 years and a half ago. And that's been very interesting because I joined thinking this is my dream job, and so I kind of went in a very, you know, dove into it, and I've learned a lot, about, you know, every business model you can think of You meet, you know, 20 founders a week, so it's it's been fascinating. But I kind of find myself missing working on one thing and in one company versus, you know, seeing 20 top level kind of looking at their data, etcetera, and then moving on and don't think my skills my top skills are not being used at all. I'm very organized. I'm very problem solver. These are things I need to take this week or, oh my god, this Fire that that that started forget everything else. So this is very just ongoing, and you could do it 24 hours a day and maybe not even get results. So, yeah, that's kind of why I'm wanting to make a move back to start ups in that kind of operational role.  Me: That was really good. That was really good background. What was your what were your days like at Jamjar? Like, what were you like, what were you doing?  Them: At at Jamjar now or at my old company?  Me: At Jamjar now. You're you're at Jamjar though. Right? Yeah.  Them: Yeah.  Me: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  Them: So I would say About 2, 3 coals a day with with the new startups. So asking them kind of the top level questions, then, I do a lot of due diligence for current deals. So, you know, dive deep into the numbers. We make a lot of it is you know, you have all this amount of information that you could present, but choosing what to present for it to be kind of received the best. So there's a bit of You know, it's it's not even manipulating data. It's manipulating kind of how you communicate it and what you put where on the slides, etcetera. And I guess a lot of it is all  Me: Yeah.  Them: So you know, trying to understand what other partners looking for to be able to get comfortable on a deal. So and and they're all so different because there's 3 of them. So it's also managing their kind of You know, at at any at at some point, you have to just say, guys, we've looked at this enough. We have to vote. We we cannot just gather information for months. So it's also knowing kind of where to stop and where where to make them stop.  Me: Oh, shit. Sorry. My yeah.  Them: Alright.  Me: My, homemade standing desk is falling apart. I just took a few Sorry. One second.  Them: I've actually really sending Chris.  Me: That so funny. I'll I'll show you what it looks like. Hold on. Where are you? I just stacked to, to, create, like, whatever, like, storage containers on top of each other.  Them: That does not look very stable.  Me: No. It's not. No. Anyway,  Them: Yeah. A lot of it is also, like, networking with my with other VCs and and going to events. So that's where we get a lot of our deals from. And recently, I maybe 6 months ago, I kind of pushed them to give me projects outside of my day to day role, I guess, because I miss being operational somewhere. So they I'm kind of doing a lot of work around our internal process and seeing where we can improve, be more efficient, kind of making it all into writing it all down versus it living in our heads so that, you know, when new people join, it's it's a bit more clear something.  Me: Yeah.  Them: A lot on that right now. Yeah.  Me: Yep. Yep. Yep. Okay. Cool. Wow. When I let you when when when you start asking me questions, I mean, because I feel like this is gonna be you're gonna you're you're very good at assessing at assessing start ups. So I feel like I gotta get my, like, VC hat on. Yeah. VC pitch hat on. But before I do that, wanna tell me a little bit more so I understand that the stuff that you're missing in your current Do you wanna tell me a little bit more about what you're looking for in your next role or, like, what you're  Them: Yeah. So I I've done quite a lot of thinking about that because  Me: yeah, what are you running towards? That make sense? Right.  Them: I've always thought I was kind of more motivated by money, but then know, if I was, I'd be working in Goldman Sachs, frankly, because  Me: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  Them: just where money is. I think what I'm looking for is first of all, to join a company that's small enough to make an impact like, impact for me is a is a huge thing. And I think why I'm not going back to my old company, which I probably could, is because they're I almost I had kind of smaller jobs, but there was nothing that I owned. So there was nothing where I could really, you know, do this and then see see how it changed things. So I think me, having, an actual tangible impact is a big thing, and and just kind of learning. I I definitely want to learn, but right now it's a lot of learning on the job, which is fun, but I I also kind of I'm big on, you know, mentoring and and, you know, also learning by by seeing. Now it it now it's again, learning on the job, but It's less about we don't all sit in an office and that I actually miss going into an office because you just learn from just seeing how people do things. And, yeah, I would say just putting my my skills to use because now they're they're really not. And the stuff like, I'm good at my job, but it doesn't the stuff that I have to do for it doesn't give me energy. It drains energy versus the stuff that I like to do, which gives me energy, but I don't do enough. So I would say kind of quite also, I think working somewhere where I'm aligned with with the mission of what they're trying to do, and I don't mean that in the sense of joining a Chris. I just mean the objective of the company needs to be something that I I I understand why they're doing it, and I understand what it takes to get there. I think in In my old role, it was you know, fashion journalism. And at some point, it just became all a bit like  Me: Yeah.  Them: guys, this war is happening. Like, why are we doing this? So there's a bit of that  Me: Yeah. Yeah.  Them: well.  Me: Might feel that building a SaaS company too. Just it might not be, you know, all that different, but  Them: Arguably, there's not there's nothing, you know, there's nothing exists unless you join, like, the Red Cross. But but, yeah, just  Me: Right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  Them: aligning a bit more with kind of the objectives. Yeah.  Me: Okay. Cool. Good. That was, that's very helpful. What are you thinking in terms of sector team size? Like, how about, like, more specifically because there are lots of potential options. Or what or what what caught your eye about us is another another way to  Them: Yeah. So I've always thought I wanted to join something  Me: Answer that.  Them: But either in consumer or that has where I understand it. I couldn't join, you know, a deep tech  Me: Yeah.  Them: b to b SaaS is fine, but but a kind of deep tech or biotech, something that I don't really I can't touch for me would be tough. So I I like the fact that you guys  Me: Yeah.  Them: you know, there's there are customers that you talk to to understand their problems, and then you  Me: Yeah.  Them: solve those problems. That's, you know,  Me: Yeah. Yeah.  Them: what I what I say when I mean consumer. State wise, I I probably don't think I could join, like, a you know, I I don't think I right now, I could be a cofounder, frankly, of a business. So I always wanted to join, you know, a business that had raised maybe a pre seed or a seed round and and kind of had you know, had a structure and a plan in place for the next couple of years as to, you know, how to use that money. And, yeah, you guys you know, you've raised from I mean, I love light speed. We we kind of don't choose as many deals now because again, they do look a lot of b to b, but yeah, I like the combination of you know, you're really working at the forefront of this new technology that Granola I don't know enough about, but would love to learn more from. And but it's also a very real problem that I mean, I'm having in my current job now. It's it's a nightmare to know, make notes to meetings, etcetera. So it's definitely you can have a tangible impact, but there's also this room to dream about, you know, this amazing works workplace where everything is automated and kind of predicts  Me: Yeah.  Them: whatever you wanna do. So I kind of like like that side of it as well.  Me: How much have you used tools like chat GPT, or have you played with any of the LLMs?  Them: I've played around with them. Chard GPT, I use GPT, I use for my for my role sometimes. Like, I'm I would say I'm not bad at prompting what I need for it to do. Always say please and thank you just in case.  Me: Just in case they take over one day? Yeah.  Them: Exactly.  Me: Yeah.  Them: And we're we're trying out actually some of the we have our weekly team meeting on Thursdays where it's about 10 of us sat around a sofa. Maybe 1 person will dial in. And I'm the one who takes all the notes for it and the action, so we've been testing how can I stop doing that and frankly, all the tools we've tested have just not not being good enough? So that that also I guess, why why I find this interesting that there's  Me: What have you tested?  Them: we've tested  Me: Yeah.  Them: Otter. What's the other one that we tested? Meeting. I'm just searching now. Yeah. Otter dotai, super normal as well. We test tested, and we tested also the, you know, the native Zoom  Me: Yeah.  Them: Zoom 1,  Me: And none of them did it. Well enough.  Them: No. I mean, they didn't do it at all, frankly. I think they'll work when you maybe have different people dialing in, but I think I have a theory that you for a lot of these, you're gonna have to kind of train it initially. I don't think especially for something as specific as our role where the actions are very specific. Victoria reach out to x person at x company. Actions we got were very discussed investment opportunities Oh, that's not that's the meeting.  Me: Yeah. Yeah.  Them: That's the 3 hour meeting, but that's not  Me: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  Them: I guess, what does  Me: Yeah. Yeah. Makes sense. Cool. Alright. Yeah. That that's very helpful. What what what would you like to know about us?  Them: what does success in this role look like for you? Is it taking stuff out of your hands? Is it more kind of proactive? What What for you would be, like,  Me: Yeah.  Them: ideal  Me: So I guess, like, I guess maybe 3 things kinda come to mind in terms of success. 1 is if just kind of, like, multiplying or scaling my ability to do things. Like, even, like, terms of, like, the stuff that I'm currently owning, can I do more of it, or or can I do it better? Does that make sense? So it's kind of like, yeah. So my capacity not not that I would, like, you would end up just owning a bunch of stuff that currently is under my my remit. So that's one. So it's kinda like you can you scale me and my cofounder Sam to there's a very specific very important part of the company that you would own. I can get into in a second. But that would be, like, that'd be clear, like, like, a short to medium term ownership, which is, like, a special project, I guess. And then, I I guess, like, longer term, it's just kind of I I would want this person to kind of to grow into, like, a COO type role. Then some c role. Doesn't have to be COO. It depends on, like, what per way what direction that person leans. Right. That's that's kind of the trajectory that I would, that I'd like foresee  Them: Yep.  Me: I bit of a a something you should know, like, a bit of a twist here, and we didn't it's actually a bit a it's a it's a a bit duplicitous in the the way we did the job listing. So I gotta tell you about it. It's like, a big part of this role for the foreseeable would be working with LLMs and building a system around But Essentially, heart of Grinnell is the quality of the notes. Like, you just talked about the quality of action items not being good enough. And, we do okay there. I mean, we do better than anything else that I've seen, but in my mind, it's still pretty basic. Right? And, what we need to do is we need to systematize. All of that. Right? So basically, for notes to be really good, at a minimum, we need to understand who you are, what job you have, what kind of meeting you're in, who's in that meeting, and what matters in terms of notes from that meeting. Right? Like, classic example, like, for a VC. Meeting with a portfolio company or you're meeting with a company you haven't invested in. Like, you're gonna care about very different things. In terms of notes, and their notes seem to look very different. So the the main thing you don't decide to, like, I guess it's like I I don't think about it 505050. Like, whatever is the highest priority thing for the company right now, like, you, me, and Sam would, sit down and, like, divvy up the work, like, every week or something. That's that's one task. The other half is owning The note system. End to end. Right? And that would be talking to users, understanding what great notes look like for every meeting type then tweaking our prompts, trying to make them better, put an evaluation framework in place, and then scale that. To lots of user types. Like, our first user type, just because they're the easiest, have been, VCs. Actually, because you have a whole lot of founder pitches, basically. And I think we've learned a lot about what it takes to make good notes, and we can make them a lot better. But then I want to launch that for recruiting, customer success, sales, like, literally, like, 10 more user types. And you'd you'd work with me on that. Like, I've been doing that. You just have the capacity to it's really it's like requires a lot of cognitive attention to do a good job on. That would be a big part of the role as well, which you may or may not or may not be interesting to you. It's not in the job listing. It's actually a separate listing on our website called the LL Lab whisperer. You should read that because that's basically under the same rule. We're gonna hire 1 person for both of those. We just put very different listings so that we get people from looking for different types of jobs.  Them: Interesting. And how much technical knowledge does that require? Is it more kind of common sense and you get because  Me: Yeah.  Them: I'm good at learning how to do things. I'm just like, play around with it. I hate when people give me demos, for example. But, yeah, how, like, how much technical AI knowledge do I need?  Me: You don't. You don't need to have so what you do need is,  Them: That's  Me: like, I'd I'd say, like, a deep interest in language So, for example, And and in and in, like, in, like, putting yourself in these It's interesting. It's almost like it spans from product Right. To to, like, scalable operations and kind of everything in between. So, like, What you need to do is a VC is a good example. Right? Like, you probably have a bunch of VCs using Fedora. Right? You would probably on on day 1 or, like, the 1st week, interview a bunch of our existing users and have them explain exactly what's wrong with our notes. Right? And then you'd take that, and then you try to you you try to define here here's what makes great notes for this for, like, a first founder pitch or for meeting with an LP or a board meeting. Right? And sure. Everyone's gonna have different preferences, but, you know, roughly, if we make notes like this, people are gonna be pretty happy. And then, you know, we'll we'll teach you how the prompting works. You don't have to know anything about that, and you'll be then you'll then there's gonna be an area of, like, learn like, just reading stuff online, like, learning coming up to speed on, like, what best practices are, but it's not like a crazy deep thing, and it's a lot of playing around. Experimentation. Right? And you might be like, so, like, a breakthrough for us was, this it's gonna sound obvious, but if you give the AI BIOS, everybody in the meeting. They're able to write way better notes. Right? So, like, one of the things we do is we go out in on the web and get buyers for all the participants, and tell you and it's oh, and they're like, okay. Yeah. So you have Right. Don't know. You're meeting with someone else from another VC firm. Right? You're probably, like, swapping deals like ideas and gossiping, not, you know, pitching each other or, like, whatever. Versus an LP, etcetera. But and then and then the other thing would be, like, picking up tooling. Like, there's a lot of tooling that's springing up. So if you wanna, like, figure out, okay. I I've tweaked the prompt to make it whatever, include more stats because, you know, good notes have lots of numbers. Then you'll just run it. There's, like, tooling, like, systems that'll be like, okay. Now run  Them: Okay.  Me: on 50 examples. And you can kinda look at it and see, hey, is it actually performing better or not? The short answer is, like, you don't need any technical, background in this. You just need to be interested and willing to learn, like, read and learn.  Them: Yeah. Oh, super interesting. It's it's rare to find these roles when you don't need to be skilled at something, if you know what I mean. Because normally, it's  Me: Yeah. Yeah.  Them: need you to have x  Me: I mean, it's a brand new  Them: beers and this and yeah. Yeah. Interesting.  Me: it's a brand new field. It's the short of it. And I think, I don't think the best practices are very far along. That makes sense. So that means we're gonna have to invent a lot of new stuff, and when you need to invent new stuff, The best way to do that is to deeply, deeply understand what the need is. Right? And then you then you can get to things like, oh, wow. I really need to understand if the the I really again, back to the UCBC example. I really need to understand if the VCs invest This is a portfolio company or not to write good notes. And then you might be like, hey, Chris, like, I think we need to ask the user we can generate notes, but then we need to ask the user some question. You know, you can imagine granola being, like, is this a portfolio company? Yes or no? You say yes, and, like, the notes change completely.  Them: Game changer already to move. Like, I can just, in my mind, picture how much it would improve things.  Me: Right. Yeah. Yeah.  Them: Yeah. And what are your kind of 12, 18 month priorities? When are you when are you guys  Me: Yeah.  Them: planning on kind of launching this, and what's  Me: Yeah. So we have, we're in closed beta.  Them: timeline for things?  Me: Far, we've onboarded every user manually. In the last, I'd say, 2 months or so, we've gotten to the point where, it's the product's pretty good for for VCs. I mean, it pains me to say that because it's so shit compared to what it will be, but it's good enough where if we onboard somebody the vast majority of them can start using us, like, 3, 4 days 5 days a week. You know, like, 3 plus days a week. So, like, our retention usage like, if we have, like, a I can show you the graph. You probably know all the names on it. Or whatever. Is, like, pretty healthy. Like, Here. Let me see.  Them: Yeah. We're big on retention at GemCheck.  Me: Yeah. I met with, somebody at Jim Dry. I can't remember, like, a while ago. When we were fundraising.  Them: Chris, maybe. She's she's, like, the  Me: Oh, maybe. Yeah. Here. I'll  Them: retention guru.  Me: not that it really matters for you to know how much people are using us, but, can you see a screen Can you see a bunch of, like, green?  Them: Yeah.  Me: Cool. These are all these are all investors. And this is our, like, 28 day usage graph. Right? This is basically if you these are the weekends. And every number is how many meetings did they use Granola for? Today? And these are all the investors we've ever onboarded. Right? So it's like, you can see the ones that didn't like, whatever this person is, didn't convert, Whatever. These this person uses a little bit of this convert. But, like, like, For a brand new 2 and these are the people we've just kind of onboarded. For a brand new tool, these people have, like, basically switched their workflow to granola which is pretty nuts given we're, like, a prelaunch, like, startup. Anyway, So  Them: Yeah. No. Great. Super interesting.  Me: Yeah. Anyway, so to to answer your question, the next milestone for us is to Let users bring on other users. Without having us having to onboard them. So we would probably the first step would be open it up for VCs to invite other VCs. Most likely in their terms. Right? And then Once we've done that, we start learning how that's working and how we can optimize it. Very aggressively move to launch other verticals. Right? Like, the recruiter sales PMs. Yeah. Managers, what have you. And kinda, like, run  Them: Yeah.  Me: run as hard as that as possible. We have early experiments in in, like, paywalls going up, like, willingness to pay has we I don't know. We've asked 2 people to pay and they both converted. So I don't have any real data, but I know that 2 people are too  Them: Yeah.  Me: The 2 companies are willing to convert. So, like, we have a lot to learn there as well.  Them: Yeah.  Me: And that to me is more of a back burner. Like, we should possibly be learning from it, but I care more about, can we get the, like, viral loop Working. Because that's really yeah. We'll we'll we'll live or die based on whether we can grow  Them: Yeah.  Me: virally, like, Yeah.  Them: I'm gonna competition wise. Obviously, there's bunch of people trying to do this. They're all at the same Roughly, you know, at the same level in terms of getting there. Is is this a kind of whoever goes faster wins? So how how are you kind of looking at just the space in general?  Me: Yeah. So I think classify Okay. So they're like the big platform. They're like the Google Meet Microsoft Teams, Zooms of the world. I don't really think about them very I think they'll have decent generic note taking capabilities. I think they're gonna focus mostly on, like, the internal team meeting scenario. And the folks we've focused on are folks who have lots of meetings with people outside their company,  Them: Yep.  Me: and that use lots of different video calling platforms. Like, you might be on Zoom, or me Alright. WhatsApp or, you know, what what what have you. So I I I think there's a big enough space there, with those types of So I don't really worry about the big platforms. There's, like, a 1000000 other startups out there. My view is I guess, is is I guess, like, the world will look 1 of 2 ways. Either the world will be won by a bunch of verticalized Like, I here's the here's the, like, recruitment focus AI notetaker, and here is the sales one, and here's the whatever one. Right? Which is very possible.  Them: Yeah.  Me: Or There might be, like, an app that kinda can handle a lot of these use cases and a lot of people use. Right? So our bet is that that latter world is possible. From we sent the last year to I mean, we done a 1000000 different iterations. So we're not our take is that the the shape of the app that needs to exist is very similar for a sales person as it is for an account executive or whatever.  Them: Yep.  Me: Different is the meetings we're in, what the notes look like, what integrations they need, what actual action items they do. But, like, the app know that when you listen, capture information,  Them: It will be the same as an end. Yeah.  Me: spit out our facts, Yeah. So and because of that, I think there's this opportunity for an app grows virally. And that means, basically, we get 1 person in the company using it, kinda like Slacked it back  Them: It's superhuman in many ways.  Me: in the day. Right? Can we get  Them: As well. You know?  Me: Yeah.  Them: The you kind of  Me: Kind of.  Them: some  Me: Kind of. I guess that yeah. Yeah.  Them: Yeah. Yeah.  Me: It's not inherently viral. I guess they'd use a thing at the bottom. And yeah. Anyway, so, like like, my basic view is that none of the products that exist out there are really that good yet. I think if there's a phenomenal product that would serve a lot of different user types. There's this opportunity for us to just grow virally.  Them: Mhmm.  Me: And and if we do that, then I think if you basically can capture a company like, we have like, the first thing client, we have the first person who used it was in customer success. But now, like, a bunch of different functions use it internally. Right? And I think if we can I think if we can achieve that, then actually we can out the only way we're gonna go faster than the competition Right? But I think if we can achieve that, then I think we do have a decent shot at it.  Them: Okay. Nice. I need I guess, last question. What would be the next  Me: Yeah.  Them: steps, in the in the process?  Me: Well, let me ask you some tactical questions really quickly and then I need to jump off. But, so we're in an in person role. Just wanna make sure you're aware of that.  Them: Yeah. Yeah.  Me: And you're comfortable with it.  Them: Just I guess my question was how what's the flexibility in terms of you know, time that you come in is it kind of a we're here at 9 AM.  Me: No. No. No. We're we're we're we're generally flexible.  Them: Type, or is it a bit more flexible?  Me: Like, half the team are parents. So, like, I'm, like, like, we're quite flexible in, like, the specific I just think there's there's a big difference if we're, like, the default is being in the office or not. Right? Also,  Them: Yeah. Yeah.  Me: don't know. Like, Andre went to work in Sicily, like, for a week like, a a little while ago. Like, that's also fine. It's just, There's a lot of magic that happens when you're in the same space.  Them: Hi. I completely I completely get it. Yeah.  Me: Okay. Cool. And then I guess one question for you just coming from VC. Like, what are what are your salary expectations? Like like, just wanna know if we're generally compatible or not. You also  Them: It's funny because people think VCs are on all these super high salaries, and I keep thinking  Me: Are you not?  Them: no. We're really not. I'm on I'm on 55 k right now.  Me: Okay. That is not very they're very high. Yeah. Okay.  Them: So so I would be kind of looking at at at that, Ben. Mark, especially yeah, considering, you know, now we have kind of insurance and all of that. So, so, yeah, definitely. I did a talk at King's College the other day where I was like, do not expect to get paid a third even of what your, banker friends are getting paid  Me: Right. Right. Right. And what's your if we did proceed, what's your start date? Like, do you have, like, a notice period? What time line are we talking about?  Them: So I have Timon's notice.  Me: Negotiable.  Them: Like, contractually, but to be honest, it's very, it's very  Me: Okay.  Them: and, my my colleague who left in Feb, she gave it was, like, a month. So it's  Me: Got it.  Them: as long as I'm not going to a competitive VC fund, it's definitely negotiable, basically.  Me: Okay. Cool. Great. Next step would be let me me think about it and get back to you. It's probably a 1 hour take home assignment. And then if you choose to do that, the next meeting would be with Sam and I, and we talk about the assignment and kinda give you a taste of some of the work you'd be doing. Cool. Awesome. It was a real pleasure meeting you.  Them: Okay. Sounds great.  Me: Have a great day. Bye.  Them: Nice to meet you. Speak soon. Alright. `,

      title: "Iterating on Prompts and Tools",
      transcript: ` Me: So What are we talking about? What's the title? Let Granola figure it out. Sure. I think that the title of this meeting is changes we need to make to infrastructure for quality. Alright. Alright. Yep. Good point. It'd be interesting if we pulled out, like, instructions we sent to Granola. Like, granola, make sure you do this. As like a, oh, yeah. That would be so nice. Yeah. And, make sure to create a to do at the end so I can just, like, see that you made to do. I'm gonna check it. That'd be, I mean, that'd be pretty sweet. If blank were, like, Anyway, For Joe to kick ass on quality Mhmm. She needs to be able to do Three things. Right. 1 is given a meeting, she needs to be able to, like, play around with the prompt and explore and try different things and like just get an intuitive feel about what works or not. She needs to be able to before she's gonna push a change to the prompts. Live? She probably needs to run it on, like, 20 meetings. Mhmm. And do a comparison and be like, hey, is this better or worse than this other prompt? Right? And then I think there's probably just, like, looking at the meat and the notes that like in retool seeing the notes that people generate and just being able to see the data that went into the prompt and, like, have some a little bit more visibility is kinda like logging in terms of those things. So these are the 3. 1, 2, 3 again. Sorry. Yeah. First is mean, I will go through it. I think I think it's so the first one is In granola, I want her to be able to try different prompts. Like, modify the prompt here. I see. Okay. So here's what I'm suggesting. For people with granola domains, added a new thing here. Mhmm. And when you select it, You you get, like, a Maybe like a model or something that pops up? And here, you can see each of the variables. Mhmm. Maybe you can edit them? Okay. And there's a deployment it's like a Vellum deployment name. Mhmm. You can you can like type in the deployment you want Mhmm. And then you hit generate. And it would hit this vellum The deployment Mhmm. With these variables. Yep. And why would you edit those? Because those are I presume, Basically, gather data, for this document. We have a function that does it. Why would you edit those? So for example, maybe there's no bio. I see. I see. You add bio. Makes sense. Yeah. Yeah. So it's like if there's no bio, I'm like, if I add a bio, does it make know, that like that kind of thing. Ideally, you you yeah. We, like, prefill these in with, like, you know, because we what whatever. Whatever we have, and then I can fuck with it and then, like, see how that how that changes things. So that's number 1. I can write this up. But I think that would like, that that would be a great starting point at least for Joe. Because she can start messing around with Yeah. Stuff. Just yeah. Just this picture and some text. Perfect. Okay. Great. So I will I'll make it a task for that. Now the other 2 them. Leosha? Okay. Sorry. Sorry. Yeah. This, you meant in our app. Right? Yes. Yes. In our app. Sam confused me. With with Josh, I would like. I'm sorry. I don't care where Mhmm. You put the button. I assume, like, by the templates would feel natural. Mhmm. You can edit you can you type in the deployment and you hit generate. And when we need this by Friday? When she she's here I mean, that'd be amazing if we could have it by Friday. Yes. Like I I think that'd be pretty cool because it'd be like, hey, Joe, now you can Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Now you can do these It should be like a couple hours. Amazing. Was thinking. If you went in the sidebar, you could see the you could keep the variables as well. Oh, that's a bit better. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We can Yeah. If you could put it in the side by the and then you could, like, Tweak it. Hit the buttons. And hit the button, then it would Nice thinking. Amazing. Okay. So the next one I'm a little Well, something I think that would make sense. Is we go to say, go retool. Think she's been looking a lot of notes. Right? Mhmm. Okay. Here. Justin Justin Holloway discussion. Open it up. Now we can look at these notes. I mean, this is, but this is I think it'd be here, it'd be really nice to see the variables again. I'm gonna get work from a cafe, so I'll see you then. Cheers, man. Yeah? Wait. I'm gonna see you tonight? You say see you in a bit, but tomorrow. Right? I think You would be nice to be able to see at least what what deployment what, prompts Deployment. Generated these? Mhmm. Mhmm. You know, at least that But also like the bios like I I basically think if we have visibility into the context that we're sending into LLMs Mhmm. Will be like, oh, shit that bio looks terrible. Or you know, stuff like that. Yeah. Yeah. With all sorts of this data, I think anywhere except vellum, I think velum has this data. And I think when we call Valum, we don't save this like, the Valum generation ID anywhere. But we can. And I think that if we store it somewhere, then I assume that Volum also allows you to query this data. So there's like basically a super naive solution that can work with with with the volume. But for new meetings. The old meetings that happened in the past, they don't have this data. That's fine. I don't care. Mhmm. It's just like a new meeting thing. Mhmm. I guess, I don't know how much I I don't know how much I wanna rely on Bellum. But I get it. It's just a thought. Well, we're using Vellum for this for that. So When you say that, for generation, the first thing that we talked about. We are using Volta. Mhmm. Yes. Okay. So, yeah. I'll I'll turn it to play. We can sort it in our database. It just it's already stored in Vellum. That's like the purpose of Vellum, I I if I understand. Correctly. Yeah, man. I don't I basically am not very convinced of any of our LLM providers? Like, we're using Vellum, but I don't think we'll want to when we get more serious. I don't think we're gonna wanna send Vellum all our sensitive data. Right. So I I at some point we'll move off of Elum. But it might not be right away. Yeah. Yeah. Basically, if Valium is gonna have that API that just, like, Basically, Yeah. Half an hour or 2 implement this entire thing? Yeah. That'd be great. Then I'll use that. If not, then Perfect. I'll just create the table and start in our database. Okay. Yeah. That'd be great. Maybe that's not the height maybe that's, like, the least lower priority out of all these but that would be really invaluable. And then The The last one Actually, maybe builds on this one is I think it would be nice for Fucking hate notifications. Like, marketing notifications. Sorry. Yeah. Good for you. Verifications. Yeah. 8. I'm watching football today. Oh, nice. The last thing Yeah. So, to be able to do that Like, basically, the I'm thinking about the flow we worked on before, which is like, hey, is this a good change? I wanna run this on 30 meeting examples. Something. Mhmm. I guess right now I can manually copy those things. Sorry. So one one thought is would be what would be cool maybe we just add an editable field here, which is like notes or metadata or whatever. But I would love to be able to Like, tag meetings. With a tag. So I could, for example, don't know. Like, I can search for I I I could do a search for 1 on 1. And then this is a hypothetical example. Right? And then I could at a bunch of examples and be like, oh, this is a good example. This is a good example. This is a good example. And tag them with, like, I don't know, 1 on 1 example. Or something like that. And then, basically, what I'm gonna end up wanting to do is I'm gonna wanna get all this in prompt layer, I think. Yeah. Is is this like, a user visible tag or, like, an admin visible tag? Just us. Just us. Yeah. Yeah. Mhmm. What I realized is, like, you know, like, like OpenID If the user is going to see this tag, like, in the data, not in the UI. Is that okay? And the data, what do you mean the data? Like, I pulled my documents data there is a column was attacked. In in the app. Mhmm. Oh, just like if they if how would they ever see it? Console log or like Like in the cache or something. Like hacking. Right? That does matter. I was, was actually like, the reason I was thinking about it because I wanted tax Just look for me. I wanted to start an interview tag. So I wanted to feature as a user. I see. I see. Maybe I build this and we use it Yeah. I I like, a way to do this maybe could be if we just had like a notes, like a granola team note, column in here. Mhmm. I I could just could just literally have, like, hashtag whatever. Anyway, there's like because it searches everything right now, we, you know, we could just have like a I could I could add comments on meetings or whatever. Anyone that's in retool. Yeah. I think so. Yeah. With comments, yeah, I think probably create a new table that So We don't need this. Oh, I see. If the tags are visible to the user, care. That's what I think. I'm I was imagining comments and I was like, oh, like Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I could get No. Definitely not comments. Yeah. Sorry. I lost some steam. Basically, I think I I think we just need to get a place in I want it I need to be able to maybe I can just do this manually again if I ever do this. But, like, in prompt layer, I just wanna create these sets. Of meetings. Yeah. And it's kind of a pain in the ass to do that So I don't know how I I don't know what the next like, what's the easiest way to streamline that process. Yeah. I guess that one is like the process itself is quite quite vague because you're talking about the step in the process where you generate, but it's not clear what's around it what do you do after you generate it. Right? So When I generate them, the notes, you mean? Yeah. Do I look at them in the app? Like, what what's the point of doing 30 of them if then I need to look at them 1 by 1? That's Kinda like is the point of just tagging, so I know We which basically which which are the meetings I like, I can open the app and filter those. Right? Imagine that I'm, Joe I cloned the meetings. And then I want to generate, so I'll go into our search bar and filter by this tag. Right? Is that the flow or Oh, no. No. No. No. No. No. No. I was imagining I was imagining I don't know. It's like I go and I I I somehow okay. Let's ignore the functionality. Here's what I wanna be to do. Yeah. I wanna go through I wanna be able to identify good examples of a certain type of meeting Mhmm. That I'm gonna use for evaluation. Right? Okay. Is currently the best place to do that Mhmm. Because that's where you can search So I go through and I I choose a bunch of meetings somehow. I then want to get all the metadata from those meetings that set of meetings, Mhmm. I'll say I choose 10 meetings. Interprompter layer. Mhmm. And then in crop layer, I can But, like, setting aside prompt layer, what would like, why the prompt layer? What are you trying to do? Right. Then I'm gonna wanna run the same meeting Through 2 different prompts. Mhmm. And see how they choose a winner. Basically. And where are you choosing that? Are you in our wrap? Or are you on the web? I was imagining. On the web Mhmm. Non prompt layer. Then I think the markdown formatting really matters. Mhmm. Rendering really matters. So I was imagining you know, web page that we control. Same as before, basically. Like, In the end, you're open It's from somewhere and you see them side by side, the original notes the first version, the second version, and And at some point there, you had the list of meetings and retool you selected those and were like, run it. And then you see them. Yeah. It can be more manual than that. And from player there in the middle, it's not important actually. Right? Just like this because you can batch Batch call this. The batch generator or whatever. I'm just like trying to figure out No. I think I think you're right. Yeah. It's just Yeah. At batch call and then somewhere I've seen it maintain I need to have the maintaining the versions of the prompts, that's all. Mhmm. Like, the the the the thing I would use prompt layer for Again, I'm not in love with it. Yeah. But if I click on registry, and click here, I can basically see like, these different versions of this prompt. Like, I can Mhmm. And, basically, I could have I could just, like, keep iterating on it Mhmm. And then hit run and then see the results. And then I could then essentially here I would, Whatever. I'd probably go in and add notes Mhmm. In prompt layer. Like, here I can just be like, was shitty or this thing happened Mhmm. Or whatever. And it would just all be here and then I could like yeah. Yeah. But then we also want to add notes in retool. Yeah. So I'm basically Yeah. I I'm I'm kinda cautious about having retool and I forgot how it's called. Vellum and proper. And yeah. Yeah. Sorry. Yeah. Pronto layer, Velum, and retool, and and it just like seems like a lot going on. Not not nothing nothing too complicated, but it's not No. That we actually need all of that. Maybe we could actually just have just retool, you know, with, with, Vellum. Because I think Vellum also has a version in. Or not. Velma's versioning is just like a fucking UI mess. You don't like how it looks like? Would you expect us to move to Pro Player from Valve at some point? I expect us at some point to move to something like prompt layer. Where The prompts were just like, prompt layer like that. Is it it we don't proxy through like, Velum, we proxy through Vala? Mhmm. Whereas the way front player works is, like, you just end up calling, like, OpenAI directly. Yeah. They'd inject the prompts or whatever. Okay. But let's say, your Joe, where are you iterating on the prompts? Because she is the originally messing up with the data fields, and colon Valum. Right? The issue, like, iterating on prompts, in prompt layer and then putting them in Velum. Is that That's kinda what I was like, for now. So we don't have to change our infrastructure. This is like a a a like a for now kind of like, with the reason the reason why I was, like, I think that change we discussed in the app, I feel pretty good about. Because Like, the only annoying thing about it is I I have to change the prompt and hit deploy in Vellum. Mhmm. But at least it's kinda clean where there's a deploy like, there's a place where I can edit the prompt There's Jinja. There's, like, the template logic. Like, if this, show this. If not, show this. All that can live in Velum. Mhmm. So I I feel pretty good about that. And it's like we're we're currently using Vellum. It's like a smallest change, and all of a sudden now she can do a lot of playing. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The eval thing, I feel way I don't it's not clear to me what the right system is. I just don't know. Mhmm. Yeah. So like the first thing we talked about, I think we should definitely do that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. One seems like the the last one to do. Right? This one because we we're talking about 3 things. The first one is like the first thing we need This one is probably the last thing we need. Right? Or the second. Yeah. Yeah. I'm I'm trying to think, like, I would like to I'd like to figure out if I switch if I should move us from OpenAI to Claude. Mhmm. Like, I think that's pretty high on the list of just how do we make our notes good. And I think only feel comfortable doing that if I can look at a bunch of examples. But I could maybe just do this manually. Yeah. You you you know, I'm trying to figure out the Also, doing this in the app I think it's the proper way because in the app, you also see how fast it generates, know, Like, the web was still a proxy for Yeah. You have to do both. Like, you have to do it in the app. And I'm one bit. And I'm wondering whether it's enough. So, like, yeah. I'm just like, you're gonna explain the version where we don't need to do much. Yeah. Yeah. Sorry. Let's say you do we do have tag in in retool. Right? Yeah. So you you can keep track. Yeah. And we already have On the meeting, you're saying. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We already have the call functionality. So you can clone the meeting. Yeah. So Imagine that you just, like, opened a panel on the web on this like screen And on this screen, you have your cloned meeting, and you just, like, run generate Sorry. What's on the is this the app? Yeah. This is the app. And here you you run the generate against your new Vellum prompt, which you can again, just like set manually Yeah. I want to hit this Yeah. Yeah. Sorry. And manual Yeah. And here you see the old one. The old one. The old panel on the web. In the same way as you can see it right now. So like, `,

      summary2: `Here are the meeting notes:
  
  ## Infrastructure changes needed for quality
  
  -   Want ability for Joe to modify prompts and variables in Granola app and generate notes to test impact
      -   Add UI in app to select variables, edit them, specify Vellum deployment, and generate notes
      -   Should be a quick change, ideally have by Friday when Joe starts
  -   Visibility into prompt context data used to generate notes
      -   Show variables/data used in prompts like bios in Retool when viewing generated notes
      -   Either pull from Vellum if they provide API or store in our own database
      -   Lower priority but valuable for debugging
  -   Ability to tag example meetings to use for evaluating prompt changes
      -   Want to identify set of good example meetings of certain types
      -   Pull metadata for those meetings into prompt layer
      -   Run same meetings through different prompts to compare
      -   Use prompt layer to iterate on prompts and track versions
  
  ## Concerns about prompt/infrastructure complexity
  
  -   Cautious about spreading logic across Retool, Vellum, Prompt Layer
      -   Seems complex, want to minimize components
  -   Consider just using Retool + Vellum
      -   Vellum has some versioning
  -   Expect to move off Vellum to Prompt Layer style system eventually
      -   Want to call LLMs directly vs proxy through Vellum
  -   For now, focus on quick win of prompt editing in app
  
  ## Next steps
  
  -   Implement prompt editing UI in Granola app
      -   Allows Joe to start experimenting with prompts
      -   Aim to have ready by Friday
  -   Decide on moving from OpenAI to Anthropic Claude
      -   High priority for improving note quality
      -   Need to compare examples, can do manually for now
  -   Table showing prompt context for now
      -   Revisit Vellum API integration or own storage later
